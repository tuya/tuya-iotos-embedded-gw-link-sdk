# Tuya IoTOS Embedded Gateway Networking SDK

[English](README.md) | [中文版](README_cn.md)

## Overview
Tuya Gateway Networking SDK is the middleware that supports communication with Tuya Cloud and Tuya apps by means of the networking capabilities of devices. In this case, Tuya standard data interaction can be implemented. You can use this SDK to develop gateway products that are connected to Tuya Cloud.
- Gateway products
    The gateway networking SDK and different protocol controllers are used to create a physical gateway product. The gateway is connected to various products with different communication protocols, such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave. For example, common control centers and smart hosts in smart homes are the gateway products. Each gateway provides the gateway firmware, gateway controller, and firmware upgrade capabilities for sub-terminal devices.

- Gateway and device products
    This type of product serves as gateways to control sub-devices. The products also serve as device products. You can define the function points of the devices and realize the control of gateways.
